We interviewed our customer to learn what kind of product they wanted us to build.  We asked various questions about what could possibly be done to help the customer to give us a full picture of the end product.  During the interview, the customer prioritized some of the requirements.   From that list of requirements, we wrote user stories and ordered them according to the importance given to us by the customer.   We had a high priority list of items, followed by items the customer wanted but didn’t consider high priority, and then followed with the rest of the requirements that the customer would like but would not be absolutely necessary to make them happy.  
Based on our user stories (derived from our interactions with our customer), we created our paper prototype.  We thought through how the start screen would look, and what functionality it would have.  That led to some buttons that would lead to other screens to allow us to meet the customer’s requirements.  After reviewing our first design, we started over with a better design.   
We did research and found two options for building java GUI’s -  JavaFX and Swing.  We ended up choosing JavaFX because it was a newer technology, and it appears that JavaFX is becoming more popular in the development community.  
We had discussions on how we were going to develop our software.  There was a disagreement between writing the code first or writing the tests first.  We ended up with a healthy agreement on using TDD (test driven development).   Our standups were productive.  Our communication throughout via slack, text, google hangouts and in person has been without issue.  We will have far more to say once we start writing and pushing code regarding our process.  So far, our process has been without issue.
