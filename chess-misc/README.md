Chess Misc
==========
position_eval.py
----------------
This is a command line tool for quickly evaluating a position in chess.
Here are the basics you need to know to get started :
* **Input** : Any FEN string(s) or a file containing FENs

```python
>> python position_eval.py <fen1> [<fen2>...<fenN>]
OR
>> python position_eval.py file <filename>
(Note : filename must have the extension .fen)
``` 
* **Output** : Current evaluation score and the best move. The FEN(s) along with the evaluation score is also written to a file called `game_moves.log`

plotter.py
----------
You can also plot evaluation score vs number of moves using
```python
>> python plotter.py
```
This will take data from `game_moves.log`

make_dataset.py
---------------
This file takes in a puzzle file in PGN format which contains Mate in 4+ puzzles, parses out the FEN strings, finds the optimal move sequence for mate and prints it to `stdout` and a file named `dataset`

JavaStockfish
=============
A thin client for Stockfish. Comes in handy when we need to use Stockfish along with the object oriented goodness of Java. See `Javadoc` for detailed explanation. The functions currently implemented are :
* Start the engine
* Stop the engine
* Get list of valid moves
* Get best move
* Send UCI commands to engine
* Get raw dump from engine
* Pretty print the board state
* Get evaluation score

ChessVision
===========
A simple tool which uses the amazing wkhtml* library to convert chess positions in FEN to either static HTML or PNG images. (Active development going on. More to come)

BitBoardGen
===========
A basic module which converts FEN strings to Bit Boards. As of now, 12 Bit Boards are being created, one for each piece type.
